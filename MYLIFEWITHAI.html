            Living in a world where AI is everywhere feels both exciting and scary at the same time. As an IT student, I use AI almost every day for schoolwork, coding, and organizing tasks.
Sometimes it makes things easier, but there are moments when I feel like I depend on it too much.
In this blog, I will share my personal experience on how AI is impacting my life in IT today.

            From my experience, AI makes my IT life easier in many ways. Whenever I struggle with coding or understanding errors, AI helps guide me in the right direction. It saves me time by summarizing lessons and giving suggestions that help me finish tasks faster. Because of AI, I am able to manage my workload better, especially during busy school weeks.

            However, using AI too much also has disadvantages. There are times when I stop thinking deeply and wait for AI to give me the answer. I realized that this habit affects my creativity and problem-solving skills. If I rely on AI too much, I might stop learning the important parts of being an IT student.
        </p>

        <p>
            For me, AI should be treated as a tool and not a replacement for  my own skills. I believe real learning happens when I try to solve problems on my own first. Using AI wisely helps me improve instead of becoming dependent on it.
        </p>

        <p>
           In conclusion, AI has a big impact on my life as an IT student. It helps me work faster, but it also challenges my creativity. My main takeaway is to use AI responsibly and continue developing my own skills. Moving forward, I plan to balance independent learning with AI support only when needed.
