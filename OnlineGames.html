        <h1><cite>The Online Games That Ruined My Eyes</cite></h1>

        <div class="content">
        <p>These particular games ruined my eyes during the pandemic. Why? Because I genuinely loved playing these games, and they got me hooked for a long time during the pandemic. You might be wondering what games these are. Let us explore the games that kept me playing so much.</p>
        
        <h2>How It Happened?</h2>
    <p>Now, why were these games fun and why did they get me hooked? Reason was that I had already been into mobile games since I did not have a PC or laptop during the pandemic. The fun I experienced was real and genuine because I met some new friends along the way. I also developed useful gaming skills such as strategy, communication, and teamwork, which made the experience even more enjoyable and fun.</p>
        
        <h2>The Effect Of Playing</h2>
        <p>This is where the reason it ruined my eyes comes in. What started as just fun and games slowly affected my vision. I didn’t notice it at first, but when face-to-face classes resumed in senior high school, everything changed. On my first day of school, I realized I couldn’t see clearly anymore, everything in front of me looked blurry. Day after day, it stayed the same, until I finally asked my parents for eyeglasses. Convincing them wasn’t easy, since they didn’t believe we needed glasses because they don’t wear any themselves yet.</p>
        
        <h2>What Games Are These?</h2>
        <p>So what games am I talking about?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Call Of Duty: Mobile</li>
        <li>Mobile Legends</li>
        <li>Roblox</li>
        <li>Shadow Fight 2</li>
        <li>Plants Vs Zombies 2</li>
        <li>Fate Grand Order</li>
        <li>The Battle Cats</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Lesson I Learned</h2>
        <p>I learned that I need to control how much time I spend playing games            to take better care of myself and my eyes. Too much screen time can              affect my health even if the activity is enjoyable. This experience              taught me the importance of taking breaks and balancing fun with                responsibility. Now, I am more aware of my limits and the consequences          of ignoring them.</p>
        
        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
        <p>It might be a bit childish to others, but playing games became a big part of my life during the pandemic. While            it brought me happiness and friendships, it also caused problems with            my eyesight. Because of this, I realized that I must reduce my gaming            time and focus on improving myself. Moving forward, I aim to balance            entertainment, health, and personal growth.</p>
